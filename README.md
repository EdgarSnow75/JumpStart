## Description 
Built using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose and TailwindCSS, JumpStart Online is meant to act as an online shopping website for the retail company, JumpStart. JumpStart Online is an standard e-commerce shopping website which has commonly seen shopping website features such as:

## Technologies Used 
The following are the languages, frameworks, programs and tools used to develop JumpStart Online.
+ **Prototyping** - Figma
> Figma is used to design the wireframes and a low-fidelity prototype of the website. Figma is a lightweight web app for designing and collabrating online seamlessly without the need to download a desktop client.
+ **Frontend** - React.js with Vite
> React.js is a good component-based JavaScript Library that I am pretty familiar with and currently learning so I chose this as my frontend. Together with Vite, it runs pretty fast.
+ **Backend** - Node.js, MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose 
> Since I'm learning JavaScript, I thought it would be cool to have the same code language behind both the frontend and the backend. That is why I chose Node.js for my backend. This was first time using a cloud-based database so I chose the one that seemed to be used the most, MongoDB Atlas. Holding them together is the Mongoose library.
+ **Styling** - TailwindCSS, DaisyUI and MaterialUI plugins.
> Ever since switching to TailwindCSS from Bootstrap, I find the former more interesting and time-efficient than the latter so I have been sticking to it. DaisyUI is a great plugin with customizatable themes and MAterualUI is used for its toasts for site notification.
